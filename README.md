# UFEN-GAN
Code and models for "Knowledge Distillation for Underwater Feature Extraction and Matching via GAN-synthesized Images" (RA-L 2025). This project introduces an adaptive GAN-based image synthesis method that estimates environment-specific underwater conditions, considering both noise distribution and forward scattering.
