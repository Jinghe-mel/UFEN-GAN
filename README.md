# UFEN-GAN

Code and models for **"Knowledge Distillation for Underwater Feature Extraction and Matching via GAN-synthesized Images"**.

This project introduces an **adaptive GAN-based image synthesis** method that estimates environment-specific underwater conditions, considering both noise distribution and forward scattering.

## Inference Code

Fast implementation for synthetic image generation is available in  `inference/`.

Please find the pre-trained weights from.

## To-Do

- [ ] Release GAN training code
